I'm a Software Developer from Oaxaca, México currently working in a mining company (until they migrate my position to a tech company that brings specialized services in IT area).

I started my professional life after a knockout at the university, the bachelor was complicated and focused in management/administrative tasks and I was looking for coding skills, after 3 semester I quit.

After 2 months working in a friend's cybercafe I received a proposal for interview in a telecommunications company called DIISA, and after that I worked for 6.5 years in multiple states over the country installing, configuring and learning a lot about many technologies like Closed Circuit Television, Control Access, Networking, Storage and Servers.

I'm tired now, I will continue this history in another oportunity... probably never XD
