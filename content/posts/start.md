Today I'll start a journey as a person~~d~~ and developer, before this I want to deep in the motivation behind my blog, this will be a practice to improve my english writing skills, because is the most used language in our working environment.

Sometimes as mexicans we want to speak, write and listen as native americans, but that never happens, with this in mind, this blog is for me and to receive feedback from others and of course from our fellow hater (ourselve).

Another motivation is my work is evolving, the last week my work changed from office to home office, is something that I try to find since 2 years, the company was acquired by another corporate and the rules changed! officially my work in home office start in 17 november and I haven't office yet in my house, the efforts to achieve the place probably started later, the changes was announced in october only to me and I started the works to have an office in november 15.


In the other hand, the blog posts don't be edited without evidence, to reflect the errors and improvements that can be done.

Thank you if you read this!
